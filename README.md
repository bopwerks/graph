# pytodo

pytodo is a todo program. It displays todo lists in three ways: as a plain list, as Covey quadrants, and as a network. The list display is like most other todo programs. Covey quadrants group tasks by their urgency and importance. The network display allows users to specify an order in which tasks should be completed. All tasks are displayed in the network display, but only actionable tasks are displayed in the quadrant and list displays. Completing a task adds any actionable tasks that follow to the list. This makes the todo list self-generating.
